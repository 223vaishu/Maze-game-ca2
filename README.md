# Maze game

The game idea of maze typically involves player to navigating through a complex network of passages or path with goal of reaching a specific destination or achieving a certain objective.
The Maze game is fun and simple. The all we need to do is move the controls left ,right,up and down.
The player navigates through the maze using controls provided by the game.This could involves joystick , arrow or the directional controls.
This game contains four balls at the corner of labyrinth we need to merge all the four balls together then need to bring that one game in the center.

There will be two modes of the games
-Easy mode
-Hard mode

In Hard mode the will be some number of black dots present, where the red balls should not touch the black dots or the game gets overs. Then we need to reset the game by clicking space button on the keyboard.
Also you can play hard level without playing the easy level all that you need to so is that press h or H on the keyboard to set the hard mode.
